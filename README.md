## 🚀 Why Vulkan?

Most 3DGS implementations rely on CUDA, locking them to NVIDIA GPUs. This project uses **standard Vulkan 1.3**, ensuring:

- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- ✅ **Any GPU vendor**: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon  
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in**: Fully open, portable GPU compute
- ✅ **Cloud-ready**: Compatible with any Vulkan-capable infrastructure

## 🛠️ Features

- **High Performance**: 30-60 FPS on 2.6M+ Gaussians at 1800x1600 resolution
- **Pure Vulkan**: Cross-vendor compute pipeline with no CUDA dependencies
- **Real-time Interaction**: WASD + mouse camera control with immediate feedback
- **Advanced Rendering**: View-dependent Spherical Harmonics (degrees 0–3)
- **Smart Memory Management**: Persistent buffer mappings and dynamic resizing
- **Flexible Architecture**: Compile-time shared memory optimization options

## 🔄 Optimization & Polish

- **Shared Memory Refinement** — The `SHARED_MEM_RENDER` compile-time option uses workgroup shared memory for significantly faster rendering, but has small tile boundary artifacts due to GLSL limitations. Working to eliminate these visual issues while preserving the performance gains.
- **Performance Tuning** — Achieving consistent 30+ FPS across all hardware configurations

---

## ⏳ Roadmap

### Platform Expansion  
- **Animation System** — Gaussian sequence loading and playback
- **Cross-Platform Build** — Universal CMake configuration for all OS
- **Mobile Support** — Native Android app + iOS via MoltenVK

### User Experience
- **ImGui Integration** — Real-time controls and debugging interface
- **Drag & Drop** — Direct PLY file loading from desktop
- **Export Features** — Render to video/image sequences
